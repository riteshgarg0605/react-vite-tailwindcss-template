# React + Vite + TailwindCSS Template

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org) + [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com/) boilerplate to be built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Getting started

1. Install [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)- a project scaffolding tool, if not already installed

```bash
npm install -g degit
```

2. Create your own project based on this template by running:

```bash
npx degit riteshgarg0605/react-vite-tailwindcss-template your-project-name
```

3. Enter the project folder

```bash
cd your-project-name
```

4. Install node modules

```bash
npm install or npm i
```

> You can make sure you are running Node.js 18 with `nvm`. Run `nvm use` to set the Node.js 18 in this project.

5. Run the project

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Done! Thank you.
